Task

 

To build a Chatbot that works on any static website (you can choose any website and a page in it with a very minimum content of your choice). That Bot should be intelligent enough to answer the questions we ask instead of giving pre-defined answers as most of the Chatbots do today. The Bot should understand the content of the page in the website and answer intelligently.

 

For example, you can build a Chatbot for any one page of https://thetazero.tech


for this exercise. Some sample questions are:

What time of company is ThetaZero?
How long it has been since you started?
What is the key objective of starting this company?
Why do you have a work-life balance policy?
What projects you are doing now?
What kind of impact this company has on the society?
 

Thetazero website is given here as an example. As I said above, you can choose any website and any one page of it to build this intelligent Chatbot.
